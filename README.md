### Hello World!

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, where I’m engaged in Large Language Model (LLM) research under the guidance of [Professor Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org). Most recently, I interned at Honeywell Aerospace as an LLM Software Engineer where I worked on model serving and a RAG-based Jira agent.


I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at University of Michigan, during which I interned at eBay as a front-end engineer. Regarding prior research, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Mohammed Saeed](https://mcircc.umich.edu/members/mohammed-saeed-md-phd) on ECG signal processing. I also enjoyed working with Ph.D. candidate [Christopher Clarke](https://csclarke.com) and [Professor Jason Mars](https://www.jasonmars.org) on NLP.
